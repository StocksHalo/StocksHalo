Web Application For Trading


Does the recent surge in Bitcoin make you feel left out?
Does investing real money give you anxiety beyond description?
There’s indeed nothing like the thrill of trading live, watching our money either go to the moon or aim for the ground.

So to make it easier for all those who want a taste before you walk into this minefield of trading equities, we’ve come up with StocksHalo- a web application that simplifies the process of signing up.Instead of going to an official broker, we are trading with Virtual currencies so you can practice until you can play with the real deal.

Data is important, but data representation is key. StocksHalo will provide you with all your charts and reliable Technical Indicators so you can grab those sweet pips, when it comes to it.
The system keeps track of all live trades made, so you can execute Around-The-Clock Demo Trading with ease. It will also be equipped with email notifications, to save you from dangerous trades; prevent incurring further losses. The application also integrates a powerful Trade History feature, so you can calculate your monthly profits, learn from your past trades, and observe overall lifetime account statistics; not to mention a calendar to keep track of all your major holidays. Finally an application that will encourage financial literacy among all peers. 
All this will be encapsulated in a minimal UI that will be devoid of clutter.
