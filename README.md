# StocksHalo
Web Application For Trading


Does the recent surge in Bitcoin make you feel left out?
Does investing real money give you anxiety beyond description?
There’s indeed nothing like the thrill of trading live, watching our money either go to the moon or aim for the ground.

So to make it easier for all those who want a taste before you walk into this minefield of trading equities, we’ve come up with StocksHalo- a web application that encourages financial literacy among all peers.Instead of going to an official broker, we are trading with virtual currencies so that you can practice until you can play with the real deal.

Data is important, but data representation is key. StocksHalo will provide you with all the charts and the reliable Technical Indicators which will help you grab those sweet pips, when it comes to it.
The system keeps track of all live trades made, so that you can execute Around-The-Clock Demo Trading with ease. It will also be equipped with email notifications to save you from dangerous trades and prevent incurring further losses. The application also integrates a powerful Trade History feature which will help you to calculate your monthly profits, learn from your past trades and observe overall lifetime account statistics; not to mention a calendar to keep track of all the major public holidays. 
All this will be encapsulated in a minimal UI that will be devoid of clutter.
